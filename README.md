My plan is to generate the interaction image. The original painting is not vivid and clear enough to show the real scene to the audience. As for the specific imaging technique, I intend to employ panoramic photography and 3D rendering to bring the paintings to life in a virtual environment. Via 360-degree view animation or use 3D zoom to dive into the landscape and give the audience a vivid immersion. Users can use their hands to drive the flows and create new variations.
## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
To implement a 3D zoom to dive into the scenery, the first step is to use 3D-related code to create a 3D model. 

For example:

Geometries (https://p5js.org/examples/3d-geometries.html) to create the gallery environment

Materials (https://p5js.org/examples/3d-materials.html) to control its lighting and reflections

Textures (https://p5js.org/examples/3d-textures.html) to display paintings

Multiple Lights (https://p5js.org/examples/3d-multiple-lights.html) to add realism and detail

Orbit Control (https://p5js.org/examples/3d-orbit-control.html) to allow users to rotate and view the gallery

Shader as a Texture (https://p5js.org/examples/3d-shader-as-a-texture.html) to achieve visual effects

Next, use the Follow 3 (https://p5js.org/examples/interaction-follow-3.html) of interaction to create a new variation.
